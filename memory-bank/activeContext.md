# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Phase**: Core Features Implementation
**Date**: May 31, 2025 - Day 1 of Hackathon

### Immediate Status
- âœ… Memory bank generation completed
- âœ… Project requirements fully analyzed from brief
- âœ… Core architecture patterns documented
- âœ… Technology stack decisions made
- âœ… Authentication system implemented
- âœ… Contact/Address book system implemented
- ðŸ”„ Real-time messaging infrastructure (next major step)

## Recent Changes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Technology Stack Confirmed**:
   - Backend: .NET C# + ASP.NET Core + SignalR
   - Frontend: React + TypeScript
   - Database: PostgreSQL (contest requirement)
   - Real-time: SignalR with automatic transport fallback

2. **Project Structure Implemented**:
   ```
   /frontend    - React TypeScript app (pending)
   /backend     - .NET C# + ASP.NET Core (âœ… implemented)
   /infrastructure - Docker & IaC scripts (pending)
   ```

3. **Development Strategy**:
   - âœ… Authentication system completed first
   - âœ… Contact management system implemented
   - ðŸ”„ Real-time messaging features next
   - Use Docker Compose for integrated development
   - Focus on contest requirements (1-2 command build/deploy)

### Key Insights Discovered
- **Time Constraint Impact**: 1-day timeline requires aggressive prioritization
- **Contest Requirements**: Must be deployable via `docker compose up` + cloud IaC
- **Scalability Needs**: 500-1000 concurrent users, 50 msg/sec throughput
- **Real-time Criticality**: WebSocket essential with polling fallback

## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Contact System Implementation (âœ… Completed)
```bash
# Contact system components implemented:
- Contact entity with bidirectional relationships
- Contact DTOs for all operations
- ContactService with full CRUD operations
- ContactsController with REST API endpoints
- Database migration for Contact schema
- Dependency injection configuration
```

### 2. Implementation Progress Update
**Priority 1 - Foundation (âœ… Completed)**:
- âœ… User authentication system (register/login)
- âœ… Database schema setup with Entity Framework Core
- âœ… JWT token management
- âœ… Contact management system with full API
- [ ] Basic React UI structure

**Priority 2 - Core Messaging (Next Phase)**:
- [ ] Message entity and database schema
- [ ] Real-time SignalR connection
- [ ] 1-on-1 message sending/receiving
- [ ] Message persistence to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Basic chat interface

**Priority 3 - Enhanced Features (Final Phase)**:
- [ ] Group chat functionality
- [ ] Image upload and sharing
- [ ] Message search capabilities

### 3. Deployment Preparation (Final Hours)
- [ ] Docker Compose configuration
- [ ] Cloud deployment scripts
- [ ] README with build instructions

## Active Technical Considerations

### Contact System Architecture Implemented
- **Bidirectional Relationships**: Proper mutual contact management
- **Status-Based Workflow**: Pending â†’ Accepted â†’ Blocked states
- **Database Optimization**: Strategic indexing for contact queries
- **Transaction Safety**: Atomic operations for contact acceptance

### Performance Optimization Focus
- **Database Indexing**: âœ… Optimized contact relationship queries
- **SignalR Management**: Efficient connection pooling and cleanup (pending)
- **Message Broadcasting**: Targeted delivery to avoid unnecessary traffic (pending)

### Security Implementation Priority
1. âœ… **Authentication**: JWT-based with secure password hashing
2. âœ… **Input Validation**: Contact system validates all inputs
3. âœ… **Authorization**: Contact operations require authentication
4. [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Prevent message spam and abuse
5. [ ] **HTTPS/WSS**: Secure all communications

### Development Workflow Decisions
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Use create-react-app and .NET project templates
- **Incremental Testing**: Test each feature as developed
- **Git Strategy**: Frequent commits with descriptive messages
- **Documentation**: Update README as features are completed

## Current Environment & Constraints

### Time Management
- **Total Time**: ~6.5 hours remaining (estimated)
- **Progress**: Contact system completed ahead of schedule
- **Critical Path**: Real-time messaging infrastructure next
- **Buffer Time**: Final 2 hours for deployment and bug fixes

### Resource Constraints
- **Cloud Provider**: Provided by contest (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- **Development Machine**: MacOS with Docker support
- **Testing Environment**: Local development with Docker Compose

### Quality Assurance Approach
- **Manual Testing**: Real-time testing during development
- **Core Functionality**: Focus on happy path scenarios
- **Error Handling**: Basic error states and user feedback
- **Performance**: Monitor during development, optimize if needed

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
1. **Real-time Communication Complexity**: 
   - Mitigation: Use SignalR for abstraction and automatic fallbacks
   - Fallback: SignalR handles Server-Sent Events/Long Polling automatically

2. **Database Performance**:
   - Mitigation: Proper indexing from start
   - Fallback: Simplify queries if needed

3. **Deployment Issues**:
   - Mitigation: Test Docker Compose early
   - Fallback: Simplified deployment if IaC fails

### Time Management Risks
1. **Feature Creep**: 
   - Mitigation: Strict priority adherence
   - Acceptance: Advanced features are optional

2. **Integration Challenges**:
   - Mitigation: Continuous integration testing
   - Buffer: Extra time allocated for final integration

## Learning & Adaptation Notes

### Effective Patterns Identified
- **Memory Bank First**: Documentation before coding proves valuable
- **Technology Alignment**: .NET + React provides strong typing and performance
- **Container Strategy**: Docker simplifies environment consistency

### Adjustments Made
- **Simplified Authentication**: No email verification to save time
- **Database Choice**: PostgreSQL accepted as requirement vs. optimization
- **UI Framework**: React chosen for rapid component development
- **Backend Framework**: .NET selected for performance and tooling

## Communication & Collaboration

### Documentation Strategy
- **Real-time Updates**: Update memory bank as work progresses
- **Code Comments**: Inline documentation for contest reviewers
