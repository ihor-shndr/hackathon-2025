# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Phase**: Project Initialization & Memory Bank Setup
**Date**: May 31, 2025 - Day 1 of Hackathon

### Immediate Status
- âœ… Memory bank generation in progress
- âœ… Project requirements fully analyzed from brief
- âœ… Core architecture patterns documented
- âœ… Technology stack decisions made
- ðŸ”„ Setting up development environment (next step)

## Recent Changes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Technology Stack Confirmed**:
   - Backend: .NET C# + ASP.NET Core + SignalR
   - Frontend: React + TypeScript
   - Database: PostgreSQL (contest requirement)
   - Real-time: SignalR with automatic transport fallback

2. **Project Structure Planned**:
   ```
   /frontend    - React TypeScript app
   /backend     - .NET C# + ASP.NET Core
   /infrastructure - Docker & IaC scripts
   ```

3. **Development Strategy**:
   - Prioritize core messaging features first
   - Use Docker Compose for integrated development
   - Focus on contest requirements (1-2 command build/deploy)

### Key Insights Discovered
- **Time Constraint Impact**: 1-day timeline requires aggressive prioritization
- **Contest Requirements**: Must be deployable via `docker compose up` + cloud IaC
- **Scalability Needs**: 500-1000 concurrent users, 50 msg/sec throughput
- **Real-time Criticality**: WebSocket essential with polling fallback

## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Development Environment Setup (Next)
```bash
# Project structure creation
mkdir frontend backend infrastructure
cd frontend && npx create-react-app . --template typescript
cd ../backend && dotnet new webapi -n Backend && cd Backend
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
dotnet add package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL
```

### 2. Core Feature Implementation Priority
**Priority 1 - Foundation (Hours 1-3)**:
- [ ] User authentication system (register/login)
- [ ] Database schema setup with Entity Framework Core
- [ ] Basic React UI structure
- [ ] JWT token management

**Priority 2 - Core Messaging (Hours 4-6)**:
- [ ] Real-time SignalR connection
- [ ] 1-on-1 message sending/receiving
- [ ] Message persistence to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Basic chat interface

**Priority 3 - Enhanced Features (Hours 7-8)**:
- [ ] Contact management system
- [ ] Group chat functionality
- [ ] Image upload and sharing

### 3. Deployment Preparation (Final Hours)
- [ ] Docker Compose configuration
- [ ] Cloud deployment scripts
- [ ] README with build instructions

## Active Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization Focus
- **Database Indexing**: Optimize for message history queries
- **SignalR Management**: Efficient connection pooling and cleanup
- **Message Broadcasting**: Targeted delivery to avoid unnecessary traffic

### Security Implementation Priority
1. **Authentication**: JWT-based with secure password hashing
2. **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent message spam and abuse
4. **HTTPS/WSS**: Secure all communications

### Development Workflow Decisions
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Use create-react-app and .NET project templates
- **Incremental Testing**: Test each feature as developed
- **Git Strategy**: Frequent commits with descriptive messages
- **Documentation**: Update README as features are completed

## Current Environment & Constraints

### Time Management
- **Total Time**: 8 hours remaining (estimated)
- **Critical Path**: Core messaging must work by hour 6
- **Buffer Time**: Final 2 hours for deployment and bug fixes

### Resource Constraints
- **Cloud Provider**: Provided by contest (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- **Development Machine**: MacOS with Docker support
- **Testing Environment**: Local development with Docker Compose

### Quality Assurance Approach
- **Manual Testing**: Real-time testing during development
- **Core Functionality**: Focus on happy path scenarios
- **Error Handling**: Basic error states and user feedback
- **Performance**: Monitor during development, optimize if needed

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
1. **Real-time Communication Complexity**: 
   - Mitigation: Use SignalR for abstraction and automatic fallbacks
   - Fallback: SignalR handles Server-Sent Events/Long Polling automatically

2. **Database Performance**:
   - Mitigation: Proper indexing from start
   - Fallback: Simplify queries if needed

3. **Deployment Issues**:
   - Mitigation: Test Docker Compose early
   - Fallback: Simplified deployment if IaC fails

### Time Management Risks
1. **Feature Creep**: 
   - Mitigation: Strict priority adherence
   - Acceptance: Advanced features are optional

2. **Integration Challenges**:
   - Mitigation: Continuous integration testing
   - Buffer: Extra time allocated for final integration

## Learning & Adaptation Notes

### Effective Patterns Identified
- **Memory Bank First**: Documentation before coding proves valuable
- **Technology Alignment**: .NET + React provides strong typing and performance
- **Container Strategy**: Docker simplifies environment consistency

### Adjustments Made
- **Simplified Authentication**: No email verification to save time
- **Database Choice**: PostgreSQL accepted as requirement vs. optimization
- **UI Framework**: React chosen for rapid component development
- **Backend Framework**: .NET selected for performance and tooling

## Communication & Collaboration

### Documentation Strategy
- **Real-time Updates**: Update memory bank as work progresses
- **Code Comments**: Inline documentation for contest reviewers
- **README Maintenance**: Keep deployment instructions current

### Contest Evaluation Preparation
- **Code Quality**: Focus on readable, maintainable patterns
- **Performance Metrics**: Document achieved performance numbers
- **Security Demonstration**: Highlight implemented security measures
